# Chain Operator...

## Traditional way to compare variable (Larger Than and Smaller Than)...

var = 10
var2 = 5
var3 = 20
print(var < var3 and var > var2) # Output : True , coz 10 is smaller than 20 and larger than 20

  ## Or ...

## Using the chain operator : compare like a mathematician
# Verify if var is between two variables or not ..

var = 10
var2 = 5
var3 = 20
print(var2 < var < var3) # Output : True,
